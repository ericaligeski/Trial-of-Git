Not sure what revision I'm on anymore….lost count.

Really thinking I'm not a big fan of text edit though. Not a super great application. Jacob installed Text Wrangler for me so maybe I'll try that next. 

Now I'm trying to edit in nano. Nano seems okay but it doesn't wrap text...which is just lame. Maybe I'll try something different next.

back to text edit instead of nano….

Jacob showed me a super cool open trick - use git open <filename> wow, that's so much faster than trying to find it in the finder
